  1. exp_nature_gene.faa: original data file, categorize protein expression scores provided in previous research literature[1].
  2. coding-1027: The original data file,  where scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) correspond to groups (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 
                  groups 1, 2, 3 As a negative dataset (lowly expressed proteins: 2308 entries), 
                  group 6 served as a positive dataset (highly expressed proteins: 1973 entries). 
                  The two datasets generate test sets and training sets through the ten-fold cross-validation strategy and three sequence encoding methods[2].
  3. keras_train_cnn_lstm_v6-1027.py: A script for model building.
