Create test sets and training sets
====
  Categorize protein expression scores provided in previous research literature[1], 
  where scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) correspond to groups (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 
  groups 1, 2, 3 As a negative dataset (lowly expressed proteins: 2308 entries), 
  group 6 served as a positive dataset (highly expressed proteins: 1973 entries). 

  The two datasets generate test sets and training sets through the ten-fold cross-validation strategy and three sequence encoding methods[2].


Note
====
  "codonc3" represents: Synonymous codon number;
  "aac3" represents: The specific amino acid;
  "codonc4" represents: Specific nucleotide combination.
